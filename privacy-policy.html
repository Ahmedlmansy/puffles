                Welcome to our Privacy Policy page! When you use our web site services, you trust us with your information. This Privacy
                Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. When you share
                information with us, we can make our services even better for you. For instance, we can show you more relevant search
                results and ads, help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our
                services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. This
                is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully. Remember, you can find controls to manage your
                information and protect your privacy and security. We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible.

            </h4>
            <p class="fs-16 c-gray">
                Our customers have the right to access, correct and delete personal data relating to them, and to object to the
                processing of such data, by addressing a written request, at any time. The Company makes every effort to put in place
                suitable precautions to safeguard the security and privacy of personal data, and to prevent it from being altered,
                corrupted, destroyed or accessed by unauthorized third parties. However, the Company does not control each and every
                risk related to the use of the Internet, and therefore warns the Site users of the potential risks involved in the
                functioning and use of the Internet. The Site may include links to other web sites or other internet sources. As the
                Company cannot control these web sites and external sources, the Company cannot be held responsible for the provision or
                display of these web sites and external sources, and may not be held liable for the content, advertising, products,

                Management of Personal Data
            </h4>
            <p class="fs-16 c-gray">
                You can view or edit your personal data online for many of our services. You can also make choices about our collection
                and use of your data. How you can access or control your personal data will depend on which services you use. You can
                choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from our web site by email, SMS, physical mail, and
                telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by
                following the directions in that message. You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone
                calls, and postal mail by visiting and signing into Company Promotional Communications Manager, which allows you to
                update contact information, manage contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your
                contact information with our partners. These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of
                certain web site services.

                Information We Collect
            </h4>
            <p class="fs-16 c-gray">
                Our store collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our services. You provide some
                of this data directly, such as when you create a personal account. We get some of it by recording how you interact with
                our services by, for example, using technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage data from software
                running on your device. We also obtain data from third parties (including other companies). For example, we supplement
                the data we collect by purchasing demographic data from other companies. We also use services from other companies to
                help us determine a location based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your location. The data
                we collect depends on the services and features you use.

                How We Use Your Information
            </h4>
            <p class="fs-16 c-gray">
                Our web site uses the data we collect for three basic purposes: to operate our business and provide (including improving
                and personalizing) the services we offer, to send communications, including promotional communications, and to display
                advertising. In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect through the various web site services you use to
                give you a more seamless, consistent and personalized experience. However, to enhance privacy, we have built in
                technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations. For example, we store data we
                collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly
                identifies you, such as your name, email address or phone number.

                Sharing Your Information
            </h4>
            <p class="fs-16 c-gray">
                We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you
                have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so. When you
                provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment
                transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. In addition, we
                share personal data among our controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents
                working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we've hired to provide
                customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data
                in order to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security
                requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose
                personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.
